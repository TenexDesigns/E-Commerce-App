Building an e-commerce backend using Spring Boot involves several components such as user management, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing. Here's a high-level overview of how you could structure your backend:

1. **User Service**: This service will handle user registration, authentication, and profile management. You will need a `User` model class and a `UserService` to manage user data.

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String username;
    private String password;
    // other fields as needed
}

@Service
public class UserService {
    // user repository for database operations
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    // methods for user registration, authentication, etc.
}
```

2. **Product Service**: This service will manage your product catalog. You will need a `Product` model class and a `ProductService` to manage product data.

```java
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String description;
    private double price;
    // other fields as needed
}

@Service
public class ProductService {
    // product repository for database operations
    private final ProductRepository productRepository;

    public ProductService(ProductRepository productRepository) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository;
    }

    // methods for adding, updating, deleting products, etc.
}
```

3. **Order Service**: This service will handle the shopping cart and order placement functionality. You will need `Order` and `OrderItem` model classes and an `OrderService` to manage order data.

```java
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    @OneToMany
    private List<OrderItem> items;
    private double total;
    // other fields as needed
}

@Entity
public class OrderItem {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Product product;
    private int quantity;
    // other fields as needed
}

@Service
public class OrderService {
    // order repository for database operations
    private final OrderRepository orderRepository;

    public OrderService(OrderRepository orderRepository) {
        this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }

    // methods for adding items to cart, placing order, etc.
}
```

4. **Payment Service**: This service will handle payment processing. You can integrate with payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal for this. For example, with Stripe, you can use the Stripe Java library to create charges and handle payments [Source 16](https://careydevelopment.us/blog/how-to-implement-a-credit-card-payment-solution-with-spring-boot-and-the-stripe-api).

```java
@Service
public class PaymentService {
    // stripe api key
    private final String apiKey = "your_stripe_api_key";

    public Charge charge(ChargeRequest chargeRequest) throws Exception {
        Map<String, Object> chargeParams = new HashMap<>();
        chargeParams.put("amount", chargeRequest.getAmount());
        chargeParams.put("currency", chargeRequest.getCurrency());
        chargeParams.put("description", chargeRequest.getDescription());
        chargeParams.put("source", chargeRequest.getStripeToken());
        
        Stripe.apiKey = apiKey;
        return Charge.create(chargeParams);
    }
}
```

In the above code, `ChargeRequest` is a class that contains information about the charge such as amount, currency, description, and a Stripe token representing the payment source.

Remember to handle exceptions and edge cases properly, validate user inputs, and implement proper security measures like password hashing and token-based authentication.

Lastly, microservices architecture could be beneficial for an e-commerce application as it allows each service (user, product, order, payment) to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

                                                                                                       ..
