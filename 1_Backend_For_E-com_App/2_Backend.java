Developing a full-fledged e-commerce application with Flutter for the front end and Spring Boot for the backend is a substantial project, and I'll provide a high-level overview of how you can approach building the backend with Spring Boot. The specific implementation details can be quite complex and are beyond the scope of a single response. Below is a simplified roadmap and guidance for your project:

**1. Project Structure:**

Organize your Spring Boot project with a proper structure. You can use packages like `com.yourcompany.ecommerce` and divide it into subpackages based on functionality.

**2. Model Classes:**

Define your domain model classes to represent the core entities in your e-commerce application. These could include `Product`, `User`, `Order`, `Cart`, `Payment`, and more. Here's a simplified example:

```java
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private double price;
    // Other fields, getters, setters, etc.
}
```

**3. Spring Boot Microservices:**

Consider breaking down your application into microservices. For an e-commerce app, you might have microservices for user authentication, product catalog, order management, payment processing, and more. Each microservice can be a separate Spring Boot application. Here's an example of a product catalog service:

```java
@RestController
public class ProductController {
    @Autowired
    private ProductService productService;

    @GetMapping("/products")
    public List<Product> getAllProducts() {
        return productService.getAllProducts();
    }

    // Implement other CRUD operations
}
```

**4. Security and Authentication:**

Implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security. You can use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication. Spring Security provides a robust framework for securing your application.

**5. Data Storage:**

Use a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2) to store data. Spring Data JPA simplifies database interactions.

**6. Payment Integration:**

Integrate with payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, or others. Consult their documentation for APIs and SDKs to handle payment transactions securely.

**7. RESTful APIs:**

Expose RESTful APIs to allow the Flutter front end to communicate with the backend. You can use Spring's `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` annotations for this.

**8. Validation and Error Handling:**

Implement validation for incoming requests and proper error handling using Spring's validation annotations and exception handling mechanisms.

**9. Caching and Optimization:**

For a production-ready e-commerce app, consider using caching mechanisms like Redis to optimize database queries and reduce response times.

**10. Testing:**

Write unit tests and integration tests for your Spring Boot services and controllers using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito.

**11. Documentation:**

Document your APIs using tools like Swagger or Springfox for API documentation generation.

**12. Deployment:**

Host your Spring Boot applications on a cloud platform or a server of your choice. Consider using containers and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes for scalability.

Remember that building an e-commerce application is a substantial task and often involves additional complexities like handling inventory, user reviews, order fulfillment, and more. It's essential to thoroughly plan and design your backend architecture to ensure scalability, security, and reliability.

While I provided a high-level overview and examples, a complete e-commerce solution would involve more extensive code, security measures, and services. Depending on your project's complexity, you might also want to consult with experienced developers or consider using existing e-commerce platforms as a starting point.
